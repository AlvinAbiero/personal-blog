  "content": "The web development landscape continues to evolve at a breakneck pace. As we move through 2025, several key trends are reshaping how developers approach their craft.\\n\\nFirstly, WebAssembly has finally reached mainstream adoption, allowing for near-native performance in browsers. This has led to more complex applications moving from native to web platforms.\\n\\nSecondly, the rise of AI-assisted coding has transformed development workflows. Tools that can suggest entire functions or optimize existing code bases have reduced development time by an estimated 40% for many teams.\\n\\nThirdly, micro-frontends have become the standard architecture for large applications, allowing teams to work independently while maintaining a cohesive user experience.\\n\\nFinally, edge computing has shifted much of the processing that was traditionally done on servers or clients to CDN edges, dramatically improving performance for users worldwide.\\n\\nAs these trends continue to mature, web developers who adapt will find themselves at the forefront of creating the next generation of digital experiences.",
